# NChess
An « intelligent » numworks chessgame.

## Features
- check detection (checkmate is not detected as in my opinion it would need too much computation each move)
- legal moves only
- "special" moves (en passant, castle, promotion)
- chessboard rotation

## Installation
Load from [this numworks python script](https://my.numworks.com/python/iskandar/chess).

## Emulation
Install the `ion-numworks` and `kandinsky` python modules to make it run on your machine. These where made by this [guy](https://github.com/ZetaMap).
