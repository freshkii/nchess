# NChess
An « intelligent » numworks chessgame.

## Features
- check detection (checkmate is not detected as in my opinion it would need too much computation each move)
- legal moves only
- "special" moves (en passant, castle, promotion)

## Installation
Important : the development is not finished so there's no usable script (on the numworks) as the variables/functions names make the file too big.

## Emulation
Install the `ion-numworks` and `kandinsky` python modules to make it run on your machine. These where made by this [guy](https://github.com/ZetaMap).
